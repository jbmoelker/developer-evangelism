We&apos;ve managed to remove the developer world from the commercial part of IT companies so far over the last few years that developers are very cynical about anything that does not relate to technology first and brand second - and neither marketing nor PR can deliver that.</p>\n<p>Developers however are very happy to listen to what other developers say - if these developers are very good, have their respect and deliver the message in the right way.</p>\n<p>The trick is to allow people in your company to play with your products and advertise why they are excited about them - after all the people in your company are consumers, too.</p>\n<p>The best advertiser is someone who is not consciously advertising a product but instead is so enthusiastic about it that it becomes contagious. You can empower your developers to be these people without much extra cost - all it needs is trust, a bit of time and to let them off the leash.</p>\n<p>To find out what a developer evangelist does, check out the <a href=\"http://developer-evangelism.com/handbook.php\">free handbook</a> available here or check the <a href=\"http://developer-evangelism.com/about.php\">about section</a> to learn more about the handbook and me.</p>\n<p class=\"signature\">Chris Heilmann<br>Developer Evangelist<br>Microsoft</p>\n\n      "
